I was able to acomplish required functionality for the lab. When I would try to ligh up the LEDs occasionally my right sensor would display a slight red led along with the green. I tried changing the pins, covering up other sensors, and running the code with just the left and right sensor so that it would only ouput all red or all green however I was still unable to get fix this problem. Ultimatly I was able to get the sensors to read each wall, I will try to fix this for the next parts of the lab.
