ECE382_Lab6
===========
Robot Motion

##Purpose

The purpose of Lab 6 is to gain experience using the pulse-width modulation features of the MSP430. We will program the MSP430 to generate pulse-width-modulated waveforms to control the speed / direction of the robot's motors.   

##Prelab

To set up the lab I created a outline of the motor layout and the wiring for the MSP430 to create the pwm wave.

##Functionality

Required Functionality: Demonstrate movement forward, backward, a small (< 45 degree) turn left and right, and a large (> 45 dgree) turn left and right. The robot should perform these movements sequentially, completely disconnected from a computer (no USB cord).

A Functionality: Control your robot with your remote! You should use at least four different buttons on the remote: one each to indicate motion directions of forward, backward, left, and right.
